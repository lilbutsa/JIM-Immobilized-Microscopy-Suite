# JIM-Immobilized-Microscopy-Suite
JIM is a collection of programs designed to simplify the quantitation in vitro TIRF microscopy experiments. In particular, it is designed to analyze experiments where a substrate is immobilized on a coverslip before fluorescent reagents are bound to the substrate.
Typical substrates will take the form of diffraction limited particles like liposomes, viruses, DNA origami etc. or polymers like actin filaments, fibrils etc. JIM contains specific programs to analyze the binding to arbitrary shaped substrates.

For binding analysis, the output of JIM is in the form of traces
