JIMSâ€™ Immobilized Microscopy Suite (JIM)
========================================
**JIM** is a collection of programs designed to simplify the quantitation of *in vitro* TIRF microscopy experiments. In particular, it is designed to analyze experiments where a substrate is immobilized on the surface of a coverslip before fluorescent reagents are bound to the substrate.

Check out the :doc:`getting_started` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project.
